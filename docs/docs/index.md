# Welcome to BearCart

Welcome to the realm of behavioral cloning karting.

BearCart is an autonomous driving project. The goal is to tinker an off-the-shelf RC car into an AI powered self-driving platform. The software is running on a Raspberry Pi 5 SBC with native Raspberry Pi OS.

BearCart is strongly inspired by the [DonkeyCar](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar) project.
