# Autopilot Deployment Guide

```bash
python ~/BearCart/scripts/autopilot.py
```

This script will employ the autopilot model at: `~/BearCart/models/DonkeyNet-15epoch-0.001lr.pth`.

Your BearCart's throttle will be locked in the beginning. 
Press the `R1` (data recording button) to release the engine power. 
Press the `R1` button again to stop the engine.
You may not have a perfect autopilot, so hold the controller, in case of any emergencies.
To terminate the autopilot, press `X` button.
